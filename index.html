            <h1>What is called Art ?</h1>

        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">
            <p>Art is a term that encompasses a wide range of creative expressions and manifestations and is often subjective. In its most general sense, art <p class="highlight">refers to the products of human creativity and imagination that are intended to evoke emotional responses, stimulate thoughts, or communicate ideas.</p><p>Art can take various forms and exist in diverse mediums, including visual arts such as painting, sculpture, and photography, performing arts like dance, theater, and music, literary arts such as poetry and prose, and more.

                The subjective nature of art means that its interpretation and value can vary from person to person. What one person considers art might not resonate with another, and different cultures and historical periods have produced vastly different forms of artistic expression.
